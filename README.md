# Discord-censor-bot

make sure to replace the contents of `bad_words.txt` with a list of words to censor. If you just use the words currently in `bad_words.txt`, you will be very annoyed as the bot starts to remove all messages containing a, b, c, or d

**You could also just invite the bot [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&client_id=705125626717274202)**
_The bot will have to be an administrator in order to work_
